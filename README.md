# SpotifyClone – iOS Music Streaming App

This project is a functional music streaming application built using SwiftUI and Spotify Web API. The application lets users explore songs, artists, albums, and playlists, and stream audio previews. It is designed with a modular MVVM architecture, secure OAuth 2.0 authentication, and structured API integration.

## Overview
The core objective was to understand and implement real-world concepts used in music streaming platforms, such as authentication, media playback, and API data modeling. The project demonstrates clean architecture, media handling, and reactive UI using SwiftUI and Combine.

## Key Features
- Spotify OAuth secure authentication
- Modular MVVM architecture (Auth, Home, Search, Details, Main)
- Discover songs, albums, podcasts, artists, and playlists
- Stream audio previews using AVFoundation
- API service layer using Spotify Web API and Alamofire
- Reactive UI handling with SwiftUI and Combine
